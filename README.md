## Open Plugin Settings 

This plugin allows you to create a command to open the settings tabs of a specified plugin.

## Usage

By default, the settings of the plugin itself can be opened by the command palette, with using `Open Plugin Settings: Open Plugin Settings` command.

To add the command to open the settings of another plugin, just click on the adding button, and search the plugin you want to add.
After you can use the command `Open Plugin Settings: Open <plugin name>` to open the settings of the plugin.

From the settings, you can also refresh the list to remove the deleted plugins and disable the commands of the disabled plugins.

You can also open any plugin (not registered) with the command `Open other plugin settings` and search the plugin you want to open.

## ðŸ“¥ Installation

- [x] From Obsidian's community plugins
- [x] Using BRAT with `https://github.com/mara-li/open-plugin-settings-commands`
- [x] From the release page: 
  - Download the latest release
  - Unzip `open-plugin-settings-commands.zip` in `.obsidian/plugins/` path
  - In Obsidian settings, reload the plugin
  - Enable the plugin

## ðŸ¤– Developing 
I use `npm` to develop this plugin : 
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can also create a `.env.json` file with the path to your main Obsidian Vault, as follows : 
```json
{
  "VAULT": "path/to/your/vault"
}
```

> [!NOTE]   
> You need to duplicate the `\` if you are on Windows.

### ðŸŽ¼ Languages

- [x] English
- [x] French

To add a translation:
1. Fork the repository
2. Add the translation in the `src/i18n/locales` folder with the name of the language (ex: `fr.json`). 
    - You can get your locale language from Obsidian using [obsidian translation](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-translations) or using the commands (in templater for example) : `<% tp.obsidian.moment.locale() %>`
    - Copy the content of the [`en.json`](./src/i18n/locales/en.json) file in the new file
    - Translate the content
3. Edit `i18n/i18next.ts` :
    - Add `import * as <lang> from "./locales/<lang>.json";`
    - Edit the `ressource` part with adding : `<lang> : {translation: <lang>}`
